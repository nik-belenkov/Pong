# Pong
The Pong Game on C++

Develop a program src/pong.cpp , which is a game for two
players, similar to the game "Pong". To display graphics, use only character (ASCII)
graphics (with output to the terminal). You need to implement a step-by-step option exclusively within the framework of the already studied material and the standard library.***

* ***Management:***

***a/z and k/m to move the rackets.***

***Space Bar to skip the action at the next step of the game in step-by-step mode.***

* ***Graphics***

***The field is a rectangle of 80 by 25 characters.***

***The size of the racket is 3 characters.***

***the size of the ball is 1 character.***

* ***UI/UX***

***After one of the players reaches a score of 21 points, the game displays congratulations to the winner and ends.==***

## Bonus part

It is necessary to implement Pong in interactive mode (real-time game mode), using additional libraries to simplify the processing of player actions and display symbolic graphics. The interactive mode code must be in the file src/pong_interactive.cpp . To implement the bonus part, it is mandatory to implement the basic part first.

## Important notes

* The game must be developed in C++, in a structured style and run from the terminal;

* Checking ``cppcheck``, as well as the style linter ``clang-format``.

* Instructions on how to run these tests on your computer are in the 'materials` folder.

## Some facts.

>Pong, groundbreaking electronic game released in 1972 by the American game manufacturer Atari, Inc. One of the earliest video games, Pong became wildly popular and helped launch the video game industry. The original Pong consisted of two paddles that players used to volley a small ball back and forth across a screen.

>The German-born American television engineer Ralph Baer laid the groundwork for Pong in 1958 when he proposed making simple video games that people could play on their home television sets. The Magnavox Odyssey, known as the first console video game system, was released in 1972 and offered a game of table tennis, or Ping-Pong. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell created Pong, his version of this concept, as an arcade game. A small company at the time, Atari began manufacturing the games in an old roller skating rink, and by 1972 the company had sold more than 8,000 Pong arcade machines. In 1975 Atari turned Pong into a console system game. After striking an exclusive deal with Sears, Roebuck and Company, Pong was soon in the homes of many American families. Pong’s popularity declined in the 1980s as video games temporarily went out of style, but it had already secured its place in history as the most popular arcade game up to that time. >
>In 1974 the makers of the Magnavox Odyssey sued Atari for stealing the concept for Pong. Magnavox won the lawsuit in 1977, upholding the company’s patent, but by then Atari had already licensed the patent for $700,000.
